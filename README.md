Further Description:

This is the website of a digitla marketing agency. 

My job was to refactor the code to meet accessibility standards and by doing so, also better position the page in search engines, like Google.

I did this by adding alt text and index tab attributes which allows all images to be accessible to users with vision or cognitive disabilities.

I also cleaned up the html with proper indentation, changed the title, consolidated/organized the CSS, and added comments.





This was an interesting project because it is related to digital advertising. I would lke to learn more about SEO and code relate to each other. 

Maybe I can find the perfect formula for maximum SEO and automate it somehow.
